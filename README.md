## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my portfolio. I am Harshkriti Kaur and I am excited to have you here! 

I'm an analytics enthusiast, and I've spent nearly 5 years crafting impactful data analyses and honing my skills in front-end development at Capgemini.

Driven by the curiosity for unveiling insights and shaping meaningful outcomes, my journey led me to pursue a Master's degree in Business Analytics from the University of California, Davis. This academic pursuit armed me with a comprehensive toolkit and hands-on expertise that I'm eager to put to use.

My expertise includes a deep proficiency in SQL, Python, data science, machine learning algorithms, and, data visualization and storytelling, all channeled towards crafting effective business solutions and weaving narratives through insights. If you are interested in knowing more about my work, feel free to explore the dedicated 'Projects' section.

I invite you to connect for discussions on analytics, statistics, machine learning, and all things data.
